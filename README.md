# Online Shopping Platform with Micro-services 

Blueprint project to build a product using micro-service architecture. 

The aim to provide blueprint for documentation and initial code for kick-starting any other MVP.

multiple ones so that separate teams working on it have more flexibility and freedom to contribute.
